# 👋 Hi, I’m Ashley Reagan 🌎  

I’m a **Physical Scientist** at the **U.S. Department of the Interior – Office of Surface Mining Reclamation & Enforcement (OSMRE)**, where I oversee **Abandoned Mine Land (AML)** programs across **Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maryland**.  
My work bridges **GIS, AI, and reclamation science**, bringing deep learning and modern geospatial analytics into regulatory oversight and environmental restoration.

🛰️ **Remote Sensing** • 🌲 **AML Reclamation** • 🤖 **Deep Learning for Earth Science**

## 🔬 Current Projects  

- **🌾 [WV Tree Counter](https://github.com/ashleyreagan/wv-tree-counter)**  
  Automated NDVI and vegetation mapping for OSMRE field oversight. Built in Python using Rasterio, TorchGeo, and Streamlit.

- **🗺️ AML Map Stitcher** *(in development)*  
  Automated georeferencing of scanned historic mine maps using OpenCV and AI-assisted ground control point detection.

- **💧 Post-Fire & Hydrologic Risk Models**  
  Deep learning tools for detecting erosion, subsidence, and flood risk on legacy mine lands across Appalachia.

## 🧭 About Me  

Before joining OSMRE, I worked in **environmental GIS** and **pipeline aerial surveillance**, leading unmanned systems operations and geospatial data collection for infrastructure integrity.  
I hold a **B.A. in Geography**, and my research interests include **post-fire wildlife response**, **riparian restoration**, and **AI integration in federal environmental workflows**.
