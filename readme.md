## 🪨 About Me  

I’m a **physical scientist and geospatial systems developer** working at the intersection of reclamation, AI, and environmental recovery. My work blends deep learning, field data, and remote sensing to help us see the land more clearly — especially the scars left behind by mining and industrial use.  

I build tools that bridge **historic data and modern intelligence**:  
- 🌲 [**WV Tree Counter**](https://github.com/ashleyreagan/wv-tree-counter) — an AI-assisted forestry pipeline mapping canopy density and post-mining reforestation progress using DeepForest and NAIP imagery.  
- 💧 [**AMD Water Quality Analysis**](https://github.com/ashleyreagan/AMD_Water_Quality_Pipeline) — monitoring and modeling acid mine drainage across abandoned mine lands, integrating WQP and field sensors for water restoration planning.  
- 🧠 [**MineAI**](https://github.com/ashleyreagan/MineAI) — an OCR and YOLOv8-driven geospatial intelligence system that reads century-old underground mine maps, georeferences them, and turns them into modern datasets for OSMRE and AML programs.  

Before that, I designed a **pipeline patrol and anomaly detection system** for aerial safety monitoring — integrating UAV imagery, LiDAR, and edge AI for field response and integrity mapping.  

My long-term goal is simple: to use data and machine intelligence to help the land heal — one map, one watershed, one canopy at a time.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate  

I’m always open to collaborations in:  
- Environmental data science & AI  
- Post-mining land restoration and AMD remediation  
- UAV / LiDAR geospatial systems  
- Open-source tools for federal or research applications  

If you’re working on something similar — or just curious — feel free to reach out via GitHub or start a discussion in one of my repos.  
> 🌍 *Science works best when we share the map.*
